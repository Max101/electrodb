 * This example shows how you might use electrodb to build other

 * Commander to create a simple cli application that can query
 * your models.
 * 
 * The CLI makes use of the Taskr example, and will use
 * data that was loaded via that code. If you havent already, 
 * use that example first to load data for use in this example.
